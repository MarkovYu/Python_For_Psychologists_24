# Introduction III

Today we will continue to explore `jupyter notebooks` as a central tool, resource and prerequisite for future endeavors as all of the `introduction to python`, as well as `data analyzes part` will be conducted within them.  Subsequently, we start working with the `python` programming language, as well as situate and compare it to other programming languages. However, before we get back to programming we need to address the elephant in the `virtual room`.


## Introduction to Python - I
The big moment is finally here: we will start exploring `python` itself. Within the first block of programming with `python` we will go through basics of the `python` programming language, its central aspects and building blocks, as well as its benefits generally speaking and within the context of psychology research.

## Objectives üìç

- learn basic and efficient usage of the python programming language
  - what is python & how to utilize it
  - building blocks of & operations in python
- Ask and answer questions
- Have a great time

## Materials üìì

Please see the rendered version of the `jupyter notebook` [Introduction IV - Introduction to Python I](https://aylinsgl.github.io/Python_For_Psychologists_23-24/introduction/intro_python_I.html) in the `ToC` on the left.
