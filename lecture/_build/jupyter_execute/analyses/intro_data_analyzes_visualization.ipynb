    "# Understanding `.loc` and `.iloc` in pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "In pandas, `.loc` and `.iloc` are two commonly used indexers for selecting and manipulating data in DataFrames. They serve different purposes and operate based on different selection criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "## `.loc` (Label-based Indexing)\n",
    "`.loc` is used for selecting data by labels (explicit index or column names). It allows selection based on row and column labels, making it intuitive when working with named indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features of `.loc`:\n",
    "- Uses explicit labels to select data.\n",
    "- Supports selection of single values, ranges, and lists of labels.\n",
    "- Allows Boolean indexing for conditional selections.\n",
    "- Includes both start and end labels when slicing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## `.iloc` (Integer-location Based Indexing)\n",
    "`.iloc` is used for selecting data by numerical (positional) index. It is useful when you do not rely on explicit labels and instead work with the position of rows and columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features of `.iloc`:\n",
    "- Uses integer-based index positions.\n",
    "- Supports selection of individual values, slices, and lists of indices.\n",
    "- Excludes the end index in slicing.\n",
    "- Does not recognize explicit row or column labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Differences:\n",
    "| Feature  | `.loc`  | `.iloc`  |\n",
    "|----------|--------|--------|\n",
    "| Indexing type | Label-based | Integer-based |\n",
    "| Row selection | Uses row labels | Uses row positions |\n",
    "| Column selection | Uses column names | Uses column positions |\n",
    "| Slicing behavior | Includes the end index | Excludes the end index |\n",
    "| Boolean indexing | Supported | Not supported directly |\n",
    "\n",
    "Both `.loc` and `.iloc` are powerful tools for selecting data in pandas DataFrames and should be chosen based on whether you are working with labels or numerical indices.\n"

    "Sure: this was a very specific use case and `data` but the steps and underlying principles are transferable to the majority of `data handling/wrangling` problems/tasks you might encounter. As always: make sure to check the fantastic docs of the python module you're using (https://pandas.pydata.org/), as well as all the fantastic tutorials out there. "
