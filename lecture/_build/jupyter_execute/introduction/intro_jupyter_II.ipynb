    "## What is a Debugger?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **debugger** is a tool that helps programmers find and fix errors in their code by allowing them to examine the code line-by-line as it executes. It is particularly useful for:\n",
    "- Identifying where and why code is failing\n",
    "- Inspecting variable values at different stages of execution\n",
    "- Testing logical flows and ensuring functions work as expected\n",
    "\n",
    "With a debugger, you can set **breakpoints** (specific lines where the code will pause) to inspect the state of your program and understand how data is being processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Use the Debugger in Jupyter Notebook 7\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook 7 includes a built-in debugger, but it requires a compatible kernel (like IPython 7.0 or later or **xeus-python**) to function. Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide on using the debugger:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Select a Debugger-Compatible Kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open your notebook.\n",
    "2. Go to the **Kernel** menu and select **Change Kernel**.\n",
    "3. Choose a kernel compatible with debugging (e.g., IPython or xeus-python).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don‚Äôt see a compatible kernel, ensure you have the latest version of IPython by running:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   pip install ipykernel --upgrade\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Activate the Debugger\n",
    "\n",
    "1. With a compatible kernel selected, you should see a **Debugger** button in the toolbar or under the **View** or **Kernel** menus.\n",
    "2. Click the **Debugger** button to enable debug mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Set Breakpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click in the left margin of a code cell next to the line numbers to add breakpoints. These red dots indicate where execution will pause, allowing you to inspect variables.\n",
    "2. You can add multiple breakpoints within a cell or across cells as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Run the Debugger\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run the cell with the breakpoints set.\n",
    "2. The debugger will pause execution at each breakpoint, allowing you to inspect the state of variables and the code‚Äôs behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Step Through the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "While in debug mode, use the following options to control execution:\n",
    "- **Continue**: Resume code execution until the next breakpoint.\n",
    "- **Step Over**: Move to the next line within the current function.\n",
    "- **Step Into**: Enter into a function call to debug it line by line.\n",
    "- **Inspect Variables**: The debugger panel displays variable values, letting you inspect them at each breakpoint.\n",
