    "  A **kernel** is a process that runs your Python code and keeps track of your variable states, functions, imports, and other information throughout your session. When you run code in a notebook, the kernel executes the code and sends back the results to be displayed.\n",

    "- **Types of Kernels**: While Python is the most common language for Jupyter Notebooks, Jupyter can support other languages like R, Julia, and more by changing the kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Kernel States**:\n",
    "  - **Idle**: The kernel is idle and ready to execute code.\n",
    "  - **Busy**: The kernel is running code. You will see an asterisk `[*]` next to the code cell when it‚Äôs running.\n",
    "  - **Restarting**: Sometimes, you may need to restart the kernel if it becomes unresponsive or if you want to clear all variables and reset the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Managing the Kernel**: \n",
    "  - You can interrupt or restart the kernel using the \"Kernel\" menu in the toolbar. \n",
    "  - **Restarting the kernel** clears all variables, functions, and code states, effectively resetting your environment.\n",
    "  - If a cell is taking too long to execute, you can interrupt the kernel, which stops its execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Status Indicators**\n",
    "- **Circle in the Upper-Right Corner**: This indicates the status of the kernel:\n",
    "  - **Empty circle**: The kernel is idle, and no code is currently running.\n",
    "  - **Filled circle**: The kernel is busy running code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Autosave and Checkpoints**\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks automatically save your progress periodically. However, you can manually save your notebook using **File > Save and Checkpoint** or by pressing **Ctrl + S**. Jupyter also creates checkpoints, so if something goes wrong, you can restore your notebook to a previously saved state.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Why Is the Kernel Important?\n",

    "The kernel is what makes Jupyter Notebooks interactive. It allows you to run Python code incrementally, cell by cell, and keep track of variables and data across different cells. This means you can run code, analyze data, and see results immediately without needing to run the entire program at once.\n",

    "If your notebook session becomes slow or unresponsive, or you need to reset your workspace, you can simply restart the kernel. This will clear all the stored information, allowing you to start fresh without reopening the notebook."

The `currently selected cell` is indicated with a `grey` or `green border depending` on whether the `notebook` is in `edit or command mode`. Clicking inside a `cell`'s `editor area` will enter `edit mode`. Clicking on the `prompt` or the `output area` of a `cell` will enter `command mode`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `second concept` to understand in `mouse-based navigation` is that `cell actions` usually apply to the `currently selected cell`. For example, to `run` the `code in a cell`, select it and then click the  `Run button` in the `toolbar` or the `Cell` -> `Run` menu item. Similarly, to `copy` a `cell`, select it and then click the `copy selected cells  button` in the `toolbar` or the `Edit` -> `Copy` menu item. With this simple pattern, it should be possible to perform nearly every `action` with the `mouse`.\n",
