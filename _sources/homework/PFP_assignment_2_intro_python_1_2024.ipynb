    "Ahoi hoi folks and welcome to homework assignment #2 of the \"Python for Psychologists\" course, winter term 2024. This homework assignment will be your first venture into the practical use of python and probably also your first time working with jupyter notebooks. Even though we've used `jupyter notebooks` in the seminar sessions you'll might encounter some problems or unexpected behaviors. Thus, if you encounter any problems along the way, please don't hesitate to get in touch (via e-mail or the discord server) or check back in the [`Introduction to Jupyter`](https://markovyu.github.io/Python_For_Psychologists_24/introduction/introduction_2.html) or the [`Intro to Python I`](https://markovyu.github.io/Python_For_Psychologists_24/introduction/introduction_4.html) chapters on the course website. \n",

    "\n",
    "Some general points:\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the assignment you will be asked to either provide some `answers to questions in written form` or directly `code`. Regarding the first, you can just write your answer in the empty `markdown cells` below the questions. Regarding the second, you can write your `code` in the empty `code cells` below the questions and actually `run` it so that the output (if there's one) will be included in the notebook. The `number` and `type` of `cell` you need to answer a given questions will be indicated but if you want to use more `cells` please don't hesitate to add a few. If you see something like \"Type Markdown ... or Please provide your solution here\n",
    "\", you can just click (or double-click) on it to make it a `markdown cell`. If any of this sounds confusing or unclear you can again consult the [`Introduction to Jupyter`](https://markovyu.github.io/Python_For_Psychologists_24/introduction/introduction_2.html) page. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please don't forget to save your `notebook` regularly (maybe every few minutes) either via `strg + s` on `windows` and `cmd + s` on `macOS`. Once you finished the `assignment`, pleas save the entire `notebook` via `File` -> `Save as...` and provide the following name `FirstNameSurname_pfp_2023_homework_assignment_2` where `FirstName` should be changed to your first name and `Surname` to your surname.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this homework assignment is to go through the things we talked about in the session again and deepen your understanding of them. This will entail the following parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "[1. Characteristics of the `python` programming language]()  \n",
    "[2. Modules]()  \n",
    "[3. Variables & data types]()  \n",
    "[4. Outro/Q&A]()  \n",
    "\n",
    "You should be able to answer all of the following questions given the content included in the respective sections on the website, as well as the things covered in during the session. **If you feel like some of the things asked here were actually not (sufficiently) covered during the session, please don't hesitate to let me know ASAP and we'll figure that out.** Otherwise you of course are welcome to train your \"google muscles\", just keep in mind that code directly copied from the internet should include sufficient credits (i.e. include links to the respective website as a comment in code/markdown cells). And remember that there is always more than one correct answer in `programming`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, after this way too long intro, I wish you a great time and hope this will feel less like an assignment and more like a fun add on to the session. Again: learning new things takes time and programming is by no means an exception to that. Thus don't worry if you have to look back and fourth between the assignment and the materials: we all start somewhere and you putting in the effort is already fantastic. You got this!\n",
