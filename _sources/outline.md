# General outline
Within this course, we will talk about and work through the core aspects of using `python` for a scientific project, i.e. `data acquisition` and `data analyzes`. 
In order to provide a solid basis for the practical work on these topics, they will be preceded by an in-depth `introduction` that will introduce and outline central characteristics and functions of the `python` programming language.
These three defining parts will also be used as cornerstones of the course outline and will entail respective more-detailed subsections.

## Schedule

Below is the current schedule. Depending on our progress, challenges, and the pace of learning, the content and timing may be adjusted. Each session will be divided into two parts: a lecture and a practical section where you'll work on problems in groups.


```{note}
The optimistic schedule below may be subject of change, dependent on time constraints and progress made in the previous meetings. The sessions for the following week or two will be updated here the week before.
